The freedoms provided by the LGPL license cannot be in any way negotiated upon or restricted from any of the recipients – i.e. it is not possible to make such terms for an application or a device using theLGPL library that would in any way restrict the rights provided by the LGPL. For example some means of distribution, such as online application stores, may have rules that are in conflict with LGPL, in which case those cannot be used with the LGPL licensing option of Qt.
The user of an application or device created with LGPL library has to be notified of their rights by providing a copy of the LGPL license text to the user and displaying a prominent notice about using the LGPL library – i.e. it is not allowed to hide the fact the LGPL library is used.
